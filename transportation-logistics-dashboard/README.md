# 🚚 Transportation and Logistics Tracking Dashboard

Welcome to my data analysis project focused on Transportation and Logistics!  
In this project, I built an interactive dashboard using **Power BI** to explore trends in shipment activity, delivery performance, and supplier efficiency.

##  Project Objective

To analyze and visualize transportation data to answer the following business questions:
- What are the most common shipment routes and their average distances?
- Which routes have the longest delivery times?
- When are the busiest booking and delivery periods?
- What factors contribute to shipment delays?
- Which suppliers handle the most shipments, and do they have high delay rates?
- Which customers receive the most shipments, and how timely are their deliveries?
